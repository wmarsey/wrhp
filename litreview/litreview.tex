	%% 	Mediawiki's slogan reads: ``Mediawiki: Because ideas
        %%         want to be free''. 

        %%         But qualitatively assessing these articles may be
        %%         something of a moot point.

        \section{Introduction}
        \subsection{The Research Question}
        (what is the main question/s you are trying to answer in your dissertation?)
        Define topic/Why this topic?
        Point out overall trends, gaps, themes

        %% \section{Wikipedia}
        %% It is worth giving a very brief overview of Wikipedia. In
        %% particular, it is worth decribing the opportunities and
        %% limitations of the implementation of Mediawiki software which
        %% is its foundation. 

        \section{Previous work}
        discuss your sources
        by theme, then date

        \subsection{Wikipedia}
        identify, analyse

        emblem of the Web2.0 era \cite{Mesgari2014}

        used to predict box office success \cite{Mestyan2012} But does
        it reveal westernness?

        Denning: Wikipedia risks: Accuracy, Motives, Uncertain Expertise,
        Volatility, Coverage, Sources (not many offline sources)
        \cite{Denning2005} 

        Denning says it cannot attain the status of a true
        encyclopedia without more formal content-inclusion and expert
        review procedures\cite{Denning2005} this corroborates by
        findings in \cite{Giles2005}?

        \subsubsection{On Wikipedia}
        `robust and remarkable growth'
        \cite{Kittur2007}\cite{Voss2005} 
        
        Wikipedia, at the last dump, consisted 800G of compressed data
        \cite{wiki-dump}

        \subsubsection{Evaluating Wikipedia articles}
        identify, analyse

        after article mentioned in press \cite{Lih2004}

        compared by 'experts' to 'equivalent' Encyclopedia Britannica articles \cite{Giles2005}

        found metrics of article quality through factor analysis
        \cite{Stvilia2005}

        Analysis by conflict - revisions?\cite{Kittur2007}

        WikiTrust. The most `complete' of the many of the. Exists as
        firefox plugin (though it doesn't work any more) Culmination
        of various studies that try to QUOTE \cite{Adler2007} and QUOTE CITE. It
        was assessed as recently as 2011 \cite{Lucassen2011}
       
        \subsection{Edit difference}

        Standard: Levenshtein distance \cite{Levenshtein1966}
        
        \subsection{My work in context of these sources}
        different views
        emerging topics
        gaps and inconsistencies

        \section{Conclusions}

        PREDIFINED / NOT-PREDEFINED ideas of quality. look for when
        the the article levels off? And do this by DATE rather than
        REVISION. We may assume that pageviews are more
        well-distributed than revisions

        summarize major contributions (which do we care about?)
        evaluate your current position
        point out any flaw in methodology/research/contradictions
        are there any gaps in the area which you will cover in your research?
        How will you integrate sources you have mentioned into your dissertation?
        Point out any areas for further study
