Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: \"Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose.\"</ref><ref>[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: \"The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value.\"</ref> Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as [[mysticism]] or [[mythology]]) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason]]ed argument.<ref>Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: \"Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by [[Aristotle's ethics]] demands that people follow the ''Aristotelian mean'', or balance between two vices; and [[Confucius|Confucian]] ethics argues that virtue consists largely in striving for harmony with other people. Virtue ethics in general has since gained many adherents, and has been defended by such philosophers as [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]].\n\n===Applied philosophy===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] -->\nThe thoughts a society thinks have profound repercussions on what it does. The applied study of philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[applied ethics]] in particular&nbsp;\u2013 and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu|Sun Zi]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taimiyyah]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and others&nbsp;\u2013 all of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. \n\nIn the field of [[philosophy of education]], progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey]] has had a profound impact on educational practices in the [[United States]] in the 20th century. Descendants of this movement include the current efforts in ''philosophy for children''. [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]], and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially in the years around [[World War II]]. Logic has become crucially important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], and [[computer engineering]].\n\nOther important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence, and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]], and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. This has profound impacts. For example, the strictly empirical approach of Skinner's behaviourism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]], and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields. \n\nOften philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge. What were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]], and [[economics]], for example. But as such areas of intellectual endeavour proliferate and expand, so will the broader philosophical questions that they generate.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' reported an increase in philosophy majors at [[United States]] universities in 2008.<ref>\"[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/education/06philosophy.html?em&ex=1207713600&en=6690d92b7d7470f8&ei=5087%0A In a New Generation of College Students, Many Opt for the Life Examined].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n==Eastern philosophy==\n{{Main|Eastern philosophy}}\n\nMany societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophical traditions based upon each other's works. Eastern and Middle Eastern philosophical traditions have influenced Western philosophers. Russian (which to many people still counts as Western), Jewish, Islamic, African, and recently Latin American philosophical traditions have contributed to, or been influenced by, Western philosophy: yet each has retained a distinctive identity.\n\nThe differences between traditions are often well captured by consideration of their favored historical philosophers, and varying stress on ideas, procedural styles, or written language. The subject matter and dialogues of each can be studied using methods derived from the others, and there are significant commonalities and exchanges between them.\n\n''[[Eastern philosophy]]'' refers to the broad traditions that originated or were popular in [[India]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and to an extent, the [[Middle East]] (which overlaps with Western philosophy due to the spread of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s and the continuing intellectual traffic between these societies and Europe.)\n\n===Chinese philosophy===\n[[Image:Confucius - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Confucius, illustrated in ''Myths & Legends of China'', 1922, by E.T.C. Werner.]]\n{{Main|Chinese philosophy}}\nPhilosophy has had a tremendous effect on [[Chinese civilization]], and [[East Asia]] as a whole. Many of the great philosophical schools were formulated during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] and [[Warring States Period]], and came to be known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. The four most influential of these were [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Mohism]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. Later on, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in India|India]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. (It should be noted that Eastern thought, unlike Western philosophy, did not express a clear distinction between philosophy and [[religion]].) Like [[Western philosophy]], [[Chinese philosophy]] covers a broad and complex range of thought, possessing a multitude of schools that address every branch and subject area of philosophy.\n\n''See also: [[Yin-Yang]], [[Qi]], [[Tao]], [[Li (Confucian)|Li]], [[I Ching]]''\n\n''Related Topics: [[Korean philosophy]], [[Bushido]], [[Zen]], [[The Art of War]], [[Asian Values]]''\n\n===Indian philosophy===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sankara.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Adi Shankara (centre), 788 to 820, founder of ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'', one of the major schools of Hindu philosophy.]] -->\n{{Main|Indian philosophy}}\n{{See|Hindu philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Jainism}}\n\nIn the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]], following the establishment of an [[Aryan]]\u2013[[Vedic period|Vedic]] culture, the development of philosophical and religious thought over a period of two millennia gave rise to what came to be called the six schools of ''[[Nastika|astika]]'', or orthodox, Indian or Hindu philosophy. These schools have come to be synonymous with the greater religion of [[Hinduism]], which was a development of the early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. \n\nHindu philosophy constitutes an integral part of the culture of [[South Asia|Southern Asia]], and is the first of the [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] philosophies which were influential throughout the [[Far East]]. The great diversity in thought and practice of Hinduism is nurtured by its liberal [[universalism]].\n\n===Persian philosophy===\n{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}\nPersian philosophy can be traced back as far as Old Iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts, with their ancient [[Indo-Iranian]] roots. These were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social influences such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]], and the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thought arose. These espoused a variety of views on philosophical questions, extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-influenced traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era, such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]], as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]] is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illumination school]] and the [[Transcendent theosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.  Zoroastrianism has been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy <ref name=\"Blackburn\">{{cite book|title=\"Philosophy\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''|author=Blackburn, Simon|date=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==African philosophy==\n{{Main|African philosophy}}\n\nPhilosophical traditions such as [[Africa]]n philosophy, are rarely studied by foreign academia. Since emphasis is mainly placed on Western philosophy as a reference point, the study, preservation and dissemination of valuable, but lesser known, non-Western philosophical works face many obstacles.  Key African philosophers include the Fulani [[Usman Dan Fodio]], founder of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] of [[Northern Nigeria]] and [[Umar Tall]] of [[Senegal]]; both were prolific Islamic scholars. Other African philosophers worthy of note in the pre-colonial period were [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] [http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/amo.htm] and [[Zera Yacob]] (1599\u20131692). In the post-colonial period, different images of what could be argued as \"African\" Philosophy from the level of epistemology have risen. These could include the thoughts and enquiries of such individuals as [[Cheik Anta Diop]], [[Francis Ohanyido]], CL Momoh, and [[Chinweizu]]. [http://www.npi.ucla.edu/qualquant/definition.htm]\n\nThe philosophy of the modern and contemporary African world, including the diaspora, is often known as Africana Philosophy. Key philosophers include [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Kwasi Wiredu]], [[Paget Henry]], [[Lewis Gordon]], Mabogo Percy More and many others.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n=== Introductions ===\n<div class=\"references-small\">\n*[[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Appiah, Kwame Anthony]].
