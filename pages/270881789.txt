Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: \"Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose.\"</ref><ref>[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: \"The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value.\"</ref> Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as [[mysticism]] or [[mythology]]) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason]]ed argument.<ref>Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: \"Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.\"</ref>  The word ''philosophy'' is of [[Ancient Greek]] origin: ''\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1'' (''philosoph\u00eda''), meaning \"love of wisdom.\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111487 Philosophia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=philosophy&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref><ref>The definition of philosophy is: \"1.orig., love of, or the search for, wisdom or knowledge 2.theory or logical analysis of the principles underlying conduct, thought, knowledge, and the nature of the universe\". {{cite book|title=Webster's New World Dictionary|edition=Second College}}</ref>\n\n==Branches of philosophy==\nTo give an exhaustive list of the main branches of philosophy is difficult, because there have been different, equally acceptable divisions at different times, and the divisions are often relative to the concerns of a particular period.  However, the following branches are usually accepted as the main ones.\n\n* '''[[Metaphysics]]''' investigates the nature of being and the world.  Traditional branches are [[cosmology]] and [[ontology]].\n*'''[[Epistemology]]''' is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, and whether knowledge is possible.  Among its central concerns has been the challenge posed by [[skepticism]] and the relationships between [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[justification]].\n* '''[[Ethics]]''', or 'moral philosophy', is concerned with questions of how persons ought to act or if such questions are answerable.  The main branches of ethics are [[meta-ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]].  [[Meta-ethics]] concerns the nature of ethical thought, comparison of various ethical systems, whether there are absolute ethical truths, and how such truths could be known.  Ethics is also associated with the idea of [[morality]].  [[Plato]]'s early dialogues include a search for definitions of virtue.\n* '''[[Political philosophy]]''' is the study of government and the relationship of individuals and communities to the state.  It includes questions about justice, the good, law, property, and the rights and obligations of the citizen.\n* '''[[Aesthetics]]''' deals with beauty, art, enjoyment, sensory-emotional values, perception, and matters of taste and sentiment.\n* '''[[Logic]]''' deals with patterns of thinking that lead from true premises to true conclusions, originally developed in Ancient Greece.  Beginning in the late 19th century, [[mathematician]]s such as [[Frege]] focused on a mathematical treatment of logic, and today the subject of logic has two broad divisions: [[mathematical logic]] (formal symbolic logic) and what is now called [[philosophical logic]].\n* '''[[Philosophy of mind]]''' deals with the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body, and is typified by disputes between [[dualism]] and [[materialism]].  In recent years there is an increasing connection between this branch of philosophy and [[cognitive science]].\n* '''[[Philosophy of language]]''' is the reasoned inquiry into the nature, origins, and usage of language.\n\nMost academic subjects have a philosophy, for example the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]], and the [[philosophy of history]].  In addition, a range of academic subjects have emerged to deal with areas which would have historically been the subject of philosophy.  These include [[psychology]], [[anthropology]] and [[natural science|science]].\n\nthis is a gay word\n----\n--[[Special:Contributions/72.138.113.108|72.138.113.108]] ([[User talk:72.138.113.108|talk]]) 13:07, 15 February 2009 (UTC)'''[[Bold text]]{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nkk\nk\n\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\nkk\n\nk\nk\nk\n\nk\nk\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|}'''\n\n==Eastern philosophy==\n{{Main|Eastern philosophy}}\n\nMany societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophical traditions based upon each other's works. Eastern and Middle Eastern philosophical traditions have influenced Western philosophers. [[Russian philosophy|Russian]] (which many people consider Western){{Fact|date=October 2008}}, Jewish, Islamic, African, and recently Latin American philosophical traditions have contributed to, or been influenced by, Western philosophy: yet each has retained a distinctive identity.\n\nThe differences between traditions are often well captured by consideration of their favored historical philosophers, and varying stress on ideas, procedural styles, or written language. The subject matter and dialogues of each can be studied using methods derived from the others, and there are significant commonalities and exchanges between them.\n\n''[[Eastern philosophy]]'' refers to the broad traditions that originated or were popular in [[India]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and to an extent, the [[Middle East]] (which overlaps with Western philosophy due to the spread of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s and the continuing intellectual traffic between these societies and Europe.)\n\n===Babylonian philosophy===\n:''Further information: [[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]''\n\nThe origins of [[Babylonia]]n philosophy can be traced back to the [[wisdom]] of early [[Mesopotamia]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialog]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. The [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] of the Babylonians developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), \"Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47.</ref>\n\nIt is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on [[Greek philosophy]], and later [[Hellenistic philosophy]]. The Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agonist]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]] and Plato.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), \"Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47 [43].</ref> The [[Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also known to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.\n\n===Chinese philosophy===\n{{Main|Chinese philosophy}}\n[[Image:Confucius - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Confucius]], illustrated in ''Myths & Legends of China'', 1922, by E.T.C. Werner.]]\n\nPhilosophy has had a tremendous effect on [[Chinese civilization]], and [[East Asia]] as a whole. Many of the great philosophical schools were formulated during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] and [[Warring States Period]], and came to be known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. The four most influential of these were [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Mohism]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. Later on, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in India|India]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. (It should be noted that Eastern thought, unlike Western philosophy, did not express a clear distinction between philosophy and [[religion]].) Like [[Western philosophy]], [[Chinese philosophy]] covers a broad and complex range of thought, possessing a multitude of schools that address every branch and subject area of philosophy.\n\n''See also: [[Yin-Yang]], [[Qi]], [[Tao]], [[Li (Confucian)|Li]], [[I Ching]]''\n\n''Related Topics: [[Korean philosophy]], [[Bushido]], [[Zen]], [[The Art of War]], [[Asian Values]]''\n\n===Indian philosophy===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sankara.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Adi Shankara (centre), 788 to 820, founder of ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'', one of the major schools of Hindu philosophy.]] -->\n{{Main|Indian philosophy}}\n{{See|Hindu philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Jainism}}\n\nIn the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]], following the establishment of an [[Vedic period|Vedic]] culture, the development of philosophical and religious thought over a period of two millennia gave rise to what came to be called the six schools of ''[[Nastika|astika]]'', or orthodox, Indian or Hindu philosophy. These schools have come to be synonymous with the greater religion of [[Hinduism]], which was a development of the early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. \n\nHindu philosophy constitutes an integral part of the culture of [[South Asia|Southern Asia]], and is the first of the [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] philosophies which were influential throughout the [[Far East]]. The great diversity in thought and practice of Hinduism is nurtured by its liberal [[universalism]].\n\n===Persian philosophy===\n{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}\nPersian philosophy can be traced back as far as Old Iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts, with their ancient [[Indo-Iranian]] roots. These were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social influences such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]], and the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thought arose. These espoused a variety of views on philosophical questions, extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-influenced traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era, such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]], as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]] is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illumination school]] and the [[Transcendent theosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.  Zoroastrianism has been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy <ref name=\"Blackburn\">{{cite book|title=\"Philosophy\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''|author=Blackburn, Simon|date=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Topic outline of philosophy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Introductions===\n<div class=\"references-small\">\n* [[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Appiah, Kwame Anthony]].
