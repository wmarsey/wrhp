Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: \"Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.\"</ref>  The word is of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin: \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, ''philosoph\u00eda'', \"love of wisdom\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111487 Philosophia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=philosophy&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref><ref>The definition of philosophy is: \"1.orig., love of, or the search for, wisdom or knowledge 2.theory or logical analysis of the principles underlying conduct, thought, knowledge, and the nature of the universe\". {{cite book|title=Webster's New World Dictionary|edition=Second College}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).

Traditional branches are [[cosmology]] and [[ontology]].\n*'''[[Epistemology]]''' is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, and whether knowledge is possible.  Among its central concerns has been the challenge posed by [[skepticism]] and the relationships between [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[justification]].\n* '''[[Ethics]]''', or 'moral philosophy', is concerned with questions of how persons ought to act or if such questions are answerable.  The main branches of ethics are [[meta-ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]].  [[Meta-ethics]] concerns the nature of ethical thought, comparison of various ethical systems, whether there are absolute ethical truths, and how such truths could be known.  Ethics is also associated with the idea of [[morality]].  [[Plato]]'s early dialogues include a search for definitions of virtue.\n* '''[[Political philosophy]]''' is the study of government and the relationship of individuals and communities to the state.  It includes questions about justice, the good, law, property, and the rights and obligations of the citizen.\n* '''[[Aesthetics]]''' deals with beauty, art, enjoyment, sensory-emotional values, perception, and matters of taste and sentiment.\n* '''[[Logic]]''' deals with patterns of thinking that lead from true premises to true conclusions, originally developed in Ancient Greece.  Beginning in the late 19th century, [[mathematician]]s such as [[Frege]] focused on a mathematical treatment of logic, and today the subject of logic has two broad divisions: [[mathematical logic]] (formal symbolic logic) and what is now called [[philosophical logic]].\n* '''[[Philosophy of mind]]''' deals with the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body, and is typified by disputes between [[dualism]] and [[materialism]].  In recent years there has been increasing similarity between this branch of philosophy and [[cognitive science]].\n* '''[[Philosophy of language]]''' is the reasoned inquiry into the nature, origins, and usage of language.\n\nMost academic subjects have a philosophy, for example the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the [[philosophy of logic]], the [[philosophy of law]], and the [[philosophy of history]].  In addition, a range of academic subjects have emerged to deal with areas which would have historically been the subject of philosophy.  These include [[psychology]], [[anthropology]] and [[natural science|science]].\n\n==Western philosophy==\n{{main|Western philosophy}}\n\n===History===\n{{main|History of Western philosophy}}\n\nThe introduction of the terms \"philosopher\" and \"philosophy\" has been ascribed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (see [[Diogenes Laertius]]: \"De vita et moribus philosophorum\", I, 12; [[Cicero]]: \"Tusculanae disputationes\", V, 8-9).  The ascription is based on a passage in a lost work of Herakleides Pontikos, a disciple of [[Aristotle]].  It is considered to be part of the widespread legends of Pythagoras of this time.  \"Philosopher\" replaced the word \"[[sophist]]\" (from ''sophoi''), which was used to describe \"wise men,\" teachers of [[rhetoric]], who were important in [[Athenian democracy]].  \n\nThe history of philosophy is customarily divided into six periods: [[Ancient philosophy]], [[Medieval philosophy]], [[Renaissance philosophy]], Early and Late [[Modern philosophy]] and [[Contemporary philosophy]].\n\n====Ancient philosophy (c. 600 B.C.\u2013c. A.D. 500)====\n{{ibid|date = June 2009}}\n[[Image:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]]]]\n{{Main|Ancient philosophy}}\n[[Image:Platon-2b.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato]]]]\nAncient philosophy is the philosophy of the Graeco-Roman world from the sixth century [circa 585] B.C. to the fourth century A.D.  It is usually divided into four periods: the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic period]], the periods of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and the post-Aristotelian (or [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]]) period. Sometimes a fifth period is added that includes the [[Christian]] and [[Neo-Platonist]] philosophers.  The most important of the ancient philosophers (in terms of subsequent influence) are Plato and Aristotle<ref>''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''</ref>.  \n\nThe themes of ancient philosophy are: understanding the fundamental causes and principles of the [[universe]]; explaining it in an economical and uniform way; the epistemological problem of reconciling the diversity and change of the natural universe, with the possibility of obtaining fixed and certain knowledge about it; questions about things which cannot be perceived by the senses, such as [[numbers]], [[classical element|elements]], [[universals]], and [[gods]]; the analysis of patterns of [[reasoning]] and argument; the nature of [[the good life]] and the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to pursue it; the explication of the concept of [[justice]], and its relation to various [[political systems]]<ref>''ibidem''</ref>.\n\nIn this period the crucial features of the [[philosophical method]] were established: a critical approach to received or established views, and the appeal to reason and argumentation.\n[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]]]\n\n====Medieval philosophy (c. A.D. 500\u2013c. 1350)====\n{{Main|Medieval philosophy}}\n\nMedieval philosophy is the philosophy of [[Western Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] during what is now known as the [[medieval]] era or the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Renaissance]].  Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate sacred doctrine (in [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]) with [[Secularism|secular]] learning.\n\nSome problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of [[God]], the object of [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.\n\nPhilosophers from the Middle Ages include the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] and [[Averroes]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the Christian philosophers [[Anselm]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]].\n\n====Renaissance (c. 1350\u2013c. 1600)====\n{{Main|Renaissance philosophy}}\n[[Image:Giordano Bruno Campo dei Fiori.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giordano Bruno]]]]\n\nThe Renaissance ('rebirth') was a period of transition between the theological philosophy of the Middle Ages and modern thought, in which Latin began to lose its role of the standard language for philosophical discussion. The study of classics (especially [[Plato]] and [[Neoplatonism]]) and of the humane arts, such as history and literature enjoyed a new popularity. The concept of man became the central object of philosophical reflection (most notably in [[Montaigne]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]]).\n\nWith the loosening of theological strictures on thought, the Renaissance renewed interest in natural philosophy, as with [[Nicholas of Kues]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Telesius]]. This coincided with a revival of magic, hidden ways of knowing and mastering nature (in Pico and [[Marsilio Ficino]] for example\n<ref>Pico Della Mirandola, Conclusiones philosophicae, cabalisticae et theologicae; Giordano Bruno, De Magia</ref>). Ethical and political philosophy was revived by the work of [[Machiavelli]] and in the utopias of [[Thomas More]], [[Tommaso Campanella]] and Francis Bacon. Within Christianity itself, these new movements dovetailed closely with the [[Reformation]].\n\n====Early modern philosophy (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1800)====\n{{Main|Early modern philosophy}}\n[[Image:JohnLocke.png|thumb|[[John Locke]]]]\n\nModern philosophy begins with the revival of [[skepticism]] and the rise of modern physical science.  Philosophy in this period centers on the relation between experience and reality, the ultimate origin of knowledge, the nature of the [[mind]] and its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for [[free will]] and [[God]], and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and [[political philosophy]].\n\nCanonical figures include [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Descartes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Spinoza]], [[Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Kant]].<ref>D. Rutherford (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'' (Cambridge UP, 2006)</ref> Chronologically, this era spans the 17th and 18th centuries, and is generally considered to end with [[Kant]]'s systematic attempt to reconcile Newtonian physics with traditional metaphysical topics.<ref>S. Nadler (ed.), ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', (Blackwell, 2002)</ref>\n\n====Nineteenth century philosophy====\n{{main|Modern philosophy}}\n\n[[Image:Philosophy-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]], ''Philosophy'' (1896). [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]\n\nLater modern philosophy is usually considered to begin after the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] at the beginning of the 19th-century.<ref name=Shand>Shand, John (ed.) ''Central Works of Philosophy, Vol.3 The Nineteenth Century'' (McGill-Queens, 2005)</ref> [[German idealism|German idealists]], such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Schelling]], expanded on the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.<ref>Beiser, Frederick C. ''The Cambridge Companion to Hegel'', (Cambridge, 1993).</ref>     \n\nRejecting idealism, other philosophers, many working from outside the university, initiated lines of thought that would occupy academic philosophy in the early and mid-20th century:\n* [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work in logic and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]]'s work in ethics provided the tools for early [[analytic philosophy]]\n* [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] initiated the school of [[phenomenology]]\n* [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[William James]] initiated the school of [[pragmatism]]\n* [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] laid the groundwork for [[existentialism]]\n* [[Karl Marx]] began the study of social materialist philosophy.\n\n====Contemporary philosophy (c. 1900 \u2013 present)====\n{{main|Contemporary philosophy}}\n=====20th century philosophy=====\nWithin the last century, philosophy has increasingly become an activity practiced within the university, and accordingly it has grown more specialized and more distinct from the natural sciences.  Much of philosophy in this period concerns itself with explaining the relation between the theories of the natural sciences and the ideas of the humanities or common sense. \n\nIn the Anglophone world, [[analytic philosophy]] became the dominant school.  In the first half of the century, it was a cohesive school, more or less identical to [[logical positivism]], united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to [[logic]] and [[language]].  In the latter half of the twentieth century, [[analytic philosophy]] diffused into a wide variety of disparate philosophical views, only loosely united by historical lines of influence and a self-identified commitment to clarity and rigor.  Since roughly 1960, analytic philosophy has shown a revival of interest in the history of philosophy, as well as attempts to integrate philosophical work with scientific results, especially in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].  \n\nOn continental Europe, no single school or temperament enjoyed dominance.  The flight of the logical positivists from central Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, however, diminished philosophical interest in natural science, and an emphasis on the humanities, broadly construed, figures prominently in what is usually called \"[[continental philosophy]]\".  Twentieth century movements such as [[phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[hermeneutics]], [[structuralism]], and [[poststructuralism]] are included within this loose category.\n\nMajor philosophers of the [[twentieth century]] include the following:\n\n* Jean-Paul [[Sartre]] and Albert [[Camus]], whose work in [[metaphysics]] and [[absurdism]] contrasted Nietzche's views.\n{{Expand|date=June 2009}}\n=====21st century philosophy=====\n \nThe [[21st century]]'s philosophy is difficult to clarify due to the short span of time in which philosophers have worked in the century. Only nearly one decade has passed since its beginning, however it is usually seen as being defined by the 20th-century philosophers who still survive today. These include Noam [[Chomsky]] and Saul [[Kripke]].\n\nOliver Rules\n\n===Applied philosophy===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]] -->\nThe thoughts a society thinks have profound repercussions on what it does. The applied study of philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[applied ethics]] in particular&nbsp;\u2013 and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu|Sun Zi]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taimiyyah]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and others&nbsp;\u2013 all of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions. \n\nIn the field of [[philosophy of education]], progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey]] has had a profound impact on educational practices in the [[United States]] in the 20th century. Descendants of this movement include the current efforts in ''philosophy for children''. [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]], and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially in the years around [[World War II]]. Logic has become crucially important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], and [[computer engineering]].\n\nOther important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence, and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]], and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. This has profound impacts. For example, the strictly empirical approach of Skinner's behaviourism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]], and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields. \n\nOften philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge. What were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]], and [[economics]], for example. But as such areas of intellectual endeavour proliferate and expand, so will the broader philosophical questions that they generate.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' reported an increase in philosophy majors at [[United States]] universities in 2008.<ref>\"[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/education/06philosophy.html?em&ex=1207713600&en=6690d92b7d7470f8&ei=5087%0A In a New Generation of College Students, Many Opt for the Life Examined].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n==Eastern philosophy==\n{{Main|Eastern philosophy}}\n\nMany societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophical traditions based upon each other's works. Eastern and Middle Eastern philosophical traditions have influenced Western philosophers. [[Russian philosophy|Russian]] (which many people consider Western){{Fact|date=October 2008}}, Jewish, Islamic, African, and recently Latin American philosophical traditions have contributed to, or been influenced by, Western philosophy: yet each has retained a distinctive identity.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe differences between traditions are often well captured by consideration of their favored historical philosophers, and varying stress on ideas, procedural styles, or written language. The subject matter and dialogues of each can be studied using methods derived from the others, and there are significant commonalities and exchanges between them.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}\n\n''[[Eastern philosophy]]'' refers to the broad traditions that originated or were popular in [[India]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and to an extent, the [[Middle East]] (which overlaps with Western philosophy due to the spread of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s and the continuing intellectual traffic between these societies and Europe.){{Fact|date=February 2009}}\n\n===Babylonian philosophy===\n:''Further information: [[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]''\n\nThe origins of [[Babylonia]]n philosophy can be traced back to the wisdom of early [[Mesopotamia]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialogue]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. The [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] of the Babylonians developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), \"Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47.</ref>  The Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agonist]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogues of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]] and Plato.<ref>Giorgio Buccellati (1981), \"Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47 [43].</ref> The [[Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also known to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.\n\n===Chinese philosophy===\n{{Main|Chinese philosophy}}\n[[Image:Confucius - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Confucius]], illustrated in ''Myths & Legends of China'', 1922, by E.T.C. Werner.]]\n\nPhilosophy has had a tremendous effect on [[Chinese civilization]], and [[East Asia]] as a whole. Many of the great philosophical schools were formulated during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] and [[Warring States Period]], and came to be known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. The four most influential of these were [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Mohism]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. Later on, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in India|India]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. (It should be noted that Eastern thought, unlike Western philosophy, did not express a clear distinction between philosophy and [[religion]].) Like [[Western philosophy]], [[Chinese philosophy]] covers a broad and complex range of thought, possessing a multitude of schools that address every branch and subject area of philosophy.\n\n''See also: [[Yin-Yang]], [[Qi]], [[Tao]], [[Li (Confucian)|Li]], [[I Ching]]''\n\n''Related Topics: [[Korean philosophy]], [[Bushido]], [[Zen]], [[The Art of War]], [[Asian Values]]''\n\n===Indian philosophy===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sankara.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Adi Shankara (centre), 788 to 820, founder of ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'', one of the major schools of Hindu philosophy.]] -->\n{{Main|Indian philosophy}}\n{{See|Hindu philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Jainism}}\n\nThe term ''' Indian philosophy''' (Sanskrit: '''Darshanas'''), may refer to any of several traditions of [[Eastern philosophy|philosophical thought]] that originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]], including [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Buddhist philosophy]], and [[Jain philosophy]]. Having the same or rather intertwined origins, all of these philosophies have a common underlying theme of [[Dharma]], and similarly attempt to explain the attainment of emancipation. They have been formalized and promulgated chiefly between 1,000 BC to a few centuries A.D, with residual commentaries and reformations continuing up to as late as the 20th century by [[Aurobindo]] and [[ISKCON]] among others, who provided stylized interpretations.\n\nIn the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]], following the establishment of an [[Vedic period|Vedic]] culture, the development of philosophical and religious thought over a period of two millennia gave rise to what came to be called the six schools of ''[[Nastika|astika]]'', or orthodox, Indian or Hindu philosophy. These schools have come to be synonymous with the greater religion of [[Hinduism]], which was a development of the early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. \n\nHindu philosophy constitutes an integral part of the culture of [[South Asia|Southern Asia]], and is the first of the [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] philosophies which were influential throughout the [[Far East]]. The great diversity in thought and practice of Hinduism is nurtured by its liberal [[universalism]].\n\n===Persian philosophy===\n{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}\nPersian philosophy can be traced back as far as Old Iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts, with their ancient [[Indo-Iranian]] roots. These were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social influences such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]], and the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thought arose. These espoused a variety of views on philosophical questions, extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-influenced traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era, such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]], as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]] is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illumination school]] and the [[Transcendent theosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.  Zoroastrianism has been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy<ref name=\"Blackburn\">{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|author=Blackburn, Simon|year=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia-Books}}\n{{main|Outline of philosophy}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Introductions===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Appiah, Kwame Anthony]].
