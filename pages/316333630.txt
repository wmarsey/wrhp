Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: \"The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value.\"</ref> Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions (such as [[mysticism]] or [[mythology]]) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason]]ed argument.<ref>Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: \"Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.\"</ref>  Philosophy comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 [philosophia], which literally translates to \"love of wisdom\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111487 Philosophia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=philosophy&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref><ref>The definition of philosophy is: \"1.orig., love of, or the search for, wisdom or knowledge 2.theory or logical analysis of the principles underlying conduct, thought, knowledge, and the nature of the universe\". {{cite book|title=Webster's New World Dictionary|edition=Second College}}</ref>  A synonym of philosophy is the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 [philalethia], which translates as \"love of truth\" and was the name of an ancient school of thought.\n\n==Branches of philosophy==\nThe following branches are the main areas of study:\n\n* '''[[Metaphysics]]''' investigates the nature of being and the world.  Traditional branches are [[cosmology]] and [[ontology]].\n*'''[[Epistemology]]''' is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, and whether knowledge is possible.  Among its central concerns has been the challenge posed by [[skepticism]] and the relationships between [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[justification]].\n* '''[[Ethics]]''', or 'moral philo", "tags": ["blanking"], "timestamp": "2009-09-26T17:12:26Z", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "userid": 0, "revid": 316333630, "anon": "", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "user": "217.42.190.117", "parentid": 316255254, "size": 4174}], "title": "Philosophy"}}}}
