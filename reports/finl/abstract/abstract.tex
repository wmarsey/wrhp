\begin{abstract}

This project explores the measurement of a Wikipedia revision. Using
a textbook Levenshtein distance algorithm as its basis, the algorithm
outlined here allows us to describe an edit in terms of various
appropriate metrics. The end product is a model which allows us to
examine each edit in terms of the species of the text that was edited,
and in terms of its relation to the rest of the edits in that
Wikipedia articles history.
