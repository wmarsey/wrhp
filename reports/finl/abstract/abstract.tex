In this project, we analyse Wikipedia revision histories, with a view
to automatically deriving an collaborative share for each of the
article's editors. We use automatic, semantically-na\"ive string
analysis as a basis for discussing the value of each contribution in
an article's history. We analyse the edit distance between texts in
various ways, and, in particular, try to characterise the each step of
an article's path as connected to, completely contextualised by, every
other in that history.

It strikes us that, as a Wikipedia article is something that evolves
organically out of the actions of many competing agents, then we may
measure the success of a contribution -- the smallest unit of which is
a character -- to be it's survival rate. Other studies have remarked
upon this also. However, previous studies that endeavour to
characterise or measure this survival rate concentrate on identifying
binary do/undo interaction between edits, which -- as we'll see -- is
a common occurence, but we feel is inadequate in terms of really
understanding the constant, nuanced to-and-fro of mass online
collaboration. We offer a solution in our `trajectory' technique.

We also spend time exploring value in the fact of the edit itself --
may we evaluate an edit according to it's actual content? We consider
the text as composed of numerous different species of text, dividing
it using Wikipedia's native markup convention, `wikimarkup', and look
to find correlations between text species and survival rate. Indeed
this project follows one that did only this, and most of the time
spent on this project was automating and exploring this approach.

We find that, on Wikipedia in particular, that qualitative analysis of
text, at least characterised by species in this way, does not
correlate well to survival, and thus to any kind of Wikipedia-native
`quality'. We also discuss complicating external factors.

Though this observation may render a fair amount of the text-analysis
work obsolete in the case of analysing Wikipedia in particular, the
produced software is robust and malleable, and the procedures
developed and implemented here would lend themselves well to analysing
the interaction-driven analystical paradigm formerly
aforementioned. As it stands, this work would adapt well to analysis
of more stable forms of online contribution, such as source control
models. We end by discussing and demonstrating the prospects of these
possible extensions.
