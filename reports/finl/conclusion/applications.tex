\section{Applications}
The software, as it stands, provides a fairly open and malleable
source for examining the histories of Wikipedia articles. As a
history-visualisation tool, it is different to existing tools and
allows flexibility in analysing different kinds of pages.

The modularity of the approach also allows for more radical changes to
the software. The project could be easily adapted to handle different
data, with little change. To handle GitHub document history, for
instance, merely changing the database wrapper and API wrapper classes
could be enough to begin analysing the data there, substituting the
page identifier for a file identifier, revision identifier for
commit. Our classes generally only need the two-part unique
identification in order to proceed with analysis.
