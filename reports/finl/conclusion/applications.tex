\section{Applications}
The software, as it stands, provides a fairly open and malleable
source for examining the histories of Wikipedia articles. As a
history-visualisation tool, it is different to existing tools and
allows flexibility in analysing different kinds of pages.

The modularity of the approach also allows for more radical changes to
the software. The project could be easily adapted to handle different
data, with little change. To handle GitHub document history, for
instance, merely changing the database wrapper and API wrapper classes
could be enough to begin analysing the data there. The anlaysing class
asks for text content based on a two unique identifier --- the file ID
and the revision ID. The trajectory graph, for instance, could be
plotted without trouble.
