\section{Summary of Thesis Achievements}

A good understanding of Wikipedia

A good visualisation of revisions history in the trajectory graph

ROBUST framework for fetching and analysing the text of wikipedia
revision histories. Intuitive, Extensible. Modular. 

\section{Applications}

The same framework could be changed to work with other text history
systems. Show how to adapt the code to work with github. Maybe just
make it work with github.

\section{Future Work}

From this project, two different directions are recommended. We can
either use the existing technique on text-history system or we can
change the current system to make better analyses of the existing
network. For instance, analyse other parts of Wikipedia in order to
understand better the context of each edit, like the talk page.
