\section{Discussion of results}
The basic output of the model described here is a set of numbers, a
levenshtein distance for each of the groups described in
line~\ref{dist-calc-groups} of algorithm~\ref{dist-calc} (and
described more clearly by the schema in figure~\ref{weightstable}),
and a trajectory factor, calculated by the procedure found in
algorithm~\ref{traj-calc}. As such, the output can be analysed in
numerous ways. We explore these here.
