\subsection{Data source}

Until fairly late in the project, storing large amounts of data in
local databases didn't create any notable problems. The PSQL database
used text compression as default on all string fields,\cite{psql-comp}
and the database was quick and responsive for most of the project.

However, towards the end of the project, the database was regularly
filled with data relating to ~300,000 revisions, and under this load
began to lag. We also employed ClusterSSH in order to run the program
on multiple machines,\cite{clusterssh} distributing the HTTP requests
to wikipedia and building a large database, but putting the database
under a considerable burden.
