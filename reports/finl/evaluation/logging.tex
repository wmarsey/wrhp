\section{Logging}
We implement basic but thorough info and debug logging throughout the
program, using python's `logging' package. Our logging functions are
defined in `logger.py' at the root of the package, and by importing
the functions there can write detailed info to wikidebug.log. Example
output can be found in appendix~\ref{appendix-debug}

Otherwise, the package outputs the most useful progress information to
the console, including current page, pageid and domain. It also prints
dots to the screen during the longer scraping and trajectory and
pair-distance calculations. This information is doubled in the debug
log, and can be silenced from the console using the `-S' or `--S'
options.
