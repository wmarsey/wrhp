\section{Results}
The basic output of the model described here is a set of numbers, a
levenshtein distance for each of the groups described in
line~\ref{dist-calc-groups} of algorithm~\ref{dist-calc} (and
described more clearly by the schema in figure~\ref{weightstable}),
and a trajectory factor, calculated by the procedure found in
algorithm~\ref{traj-calc}. Accompanying this is the trajectory
distance of each revision.

Through simple database queries we may also find out other related
information, such as how many edits an article has, how frequent these
edits were, and the article's final or average size.

With a large enough random sample, we begin to be able to report the
relative activity of individual editors also. If, for every page `$X$'
we also grab the page `Talk:$X$' we may see which editors were
involved in discussions around the edits, and begin to more clearly
see the context surrounding each article. We can also look for pages
named `Wikipedia:Requests\_for\_arbitration/$X$' to discover
evidence of more serious disputes. We discuss this in more detail
later.

Using the dataplot module we can output three graphs -- trajectory
graphs, a bar chart grading users by edit count, and a similar graph
grading them by the `share' of the article. This latter graph can be
modified by the application of weights. The weights allow us to take
some species of text as more important than others when calculating a
user's share in the article.

The DataPlot module can also output graphs on the database as a
whole. Running it as a script we can plot information about how the
size of articles in each language, the lengths of their histories,
etc.
