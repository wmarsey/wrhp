\section{Results}
The basic output of the model described here is a set of numbers, a
levenshtein distance for each of the groups described in
line~\ref{dist-calc-groups} of algorithm~\ref{dist-calc} (and
described more clearly by the schema in figure~\ref{weightstable}),
and a trajectory factor, calculated by the procedure found in
algorithm~\ref{traj-calc}. As such, the output can be analysed in
numerous ways.

Our basic analysis is based on the following three measures:
\begin{itemize}[]
\item \textbf{Trajectory graph.} This plots the change of the article
  over time. By measuring a levenshtein distance between each revision
  text against the final version (see algorithm~\ref{traj-calc}), we
  see the article in terms of its growth from an empty article, and
  the approach to its final version. We also plot the size of the
  article at each point of this graph for greater context.
\item \textbf{User by share.} We sum up each user's 'share' of the
  article using the calculations made during analysis, and order them
  here by user.
\item \textbf{User by edit count.} Our understanding of the previous
  graph can be made greater if we understand how many edits each user
  has made.
\end{itemize}
