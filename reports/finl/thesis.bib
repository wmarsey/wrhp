	abstract = "We present a content-driven reputation system for
                  Wikipedia authors. In our system, authors gain
                  reputation when the edits they perform to Wikipedia
                  articles are preserved by subsequent authors, and
                  they lose reputation when their edits are rolled
                  back or undone in short order. Thus, author
                  reputation is computed solely on the basis of
                  content evolution; user-to-user comments or ratings
                  are not used. The author reputation we compute could
                  be used to flag new contributions from
                  low-reputation authors, or it could be used to allow
                  only authors with high reputation to contribute to
                  controversialor critical pages. A reputation system
                  for the Wikipedia could also provide an incentive
                  for high-quality contributions. We have implemented
                  the proposed system, and we have used it to analyze
                  the entire Italian and French Wikipedias, consisting
                  of a total of 691, 551 pages and 5, 587, 523
                  revisions. Our results show that our notion of
                  reputation has good predictive value: changes
                  performed by low-reputation authors have a
                  significantly larger than average probability of
                  having poor quality, as judged by human observers,
                  and of being later undone, as measured by our
                  algorithms.",

abstract = {Wikipedia, an international project that uses Wiki
                  software to collaboratively create an encyclopaedia,
                  is becoming more and more popular. Everyone can
                  directly edit articles and every edit is
                  recorded. The version history of all articles is
                  freely available and allows a multitude of
                  examinations. This paper gives an overview on
                  Wikipedia research. Wikipedia's fundamental
                  components, i.e. articles, authors, edits, and
                  links, as well as content and quality are
                  analysed. Possibilities of research are explored
                  including examples and first results. Several
                  characteristics that are found in Wikipedia, such as
                  exponential growth and scale-free networks are
                  already known in other context. However the Wiki
                  architecture also possesses some intrinsic
                  specialities. General trends are measured that are
                  typical for all Wikipedias but vary between
                  languages in detail.},

                  of the fields inquiring about Wikipedia and the
                  limited synthesis of the extensive research, there
                  is little consensus on many aspects of Wikipedia?s
                  content as an encyclopedic collection of human
                  knowledge. This study addresses the issue by
                  systematically reviewing 110 peer-reviewed
                  publications on Wikipedia content, summarizing the
                  current findings, and highlighting the major
                  research trends. Two major streams of research are
                  identified: the quality of Wikipedia content
                  (including comprehensiveness, currency, readability
                  and reliability) and the size of
                  Wikipedia. Moreover, we present the key research
                  trends in terms of the domains of inquiry, research
                  design, data source, and data gathering
                  methods. This review synthesizes scholarly
                  understanding of Wikipedia content and paves the way
                  for future studies.}

                  contributors reveal their interests and expertise
                  through their contribution patterns. An analysis of
                  Wikipedia edit histories shows that it is often
                  possible to associate contributors with relatively
                  small geographic regions, usually corresponding to
                  where they were born or where they presently
                  live. For many contributors, the geographic
                  coordinates of pages they have edited are tightly
                  clustered. Results suggest that a wealth of
                  information about contributors can be gleaned from
                  edit histories. This illustrates the eficacy of data
                  mining on large, publicly-available datasets and
                  raises potential privacy concerns.},

                  such as Wikipedia has been a subject of widespread

                  improving user confidence in wiki information by
                  coloring the text of a wiki article based on the
                  venerability of the text. This proposal relies on
                  the philosophy that bad information is less likely
                  to survive a collaborative editing process over
                  large numbers of edits. Colorization would provide
                  users with a clear visual cue as to the level of
                  confidence that they can place in particular
                  assertions made within a wiki article.},

abstract = "A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway. ",

abstract = "This paper analyzes editing patterns of Wikipedia contributors using dynamic social network analysis. We have developed a tool that converts the edit flow among contributors into a temporal social network. We are using this approach to identify the most creative Wikipedia editors among the few thousand contributors who make most of the edits amid the millions of active Wikipedia editors. In particular, we identify the key category of “coolfarmers”, the prolific authors starting and building new articles of high quality. Towards this goal we analyzed the 2580 featured articles of the English Wikipedia where we found two main article types: (1) articles of narrow focus created by a few subject matter experts, and (2) articles about a broad topic created by thousands of interested incidental editors. We then investigated the authoring process of articles about a current and controversial event. There we found two types of editors with different editing patterns: the mediators, trying to reconcile the different viewpoints of editors, and the zealots, who are adding fuel to heated discussions on controversial topics. As a second category of editors we look at the “egoboosters”, people who use Wikipedia mostly to showcase themselves. Understanding these different patterns of behavior gives important insights about the cultural norms of online creators. In addition, identifying and policing egoboosters has the potential to increase the quality of Wikipedia. People best suited to enforce culture-compliant behavior of egoboosters through exemplary behavior and active intervention are the highly regarded coolfarmers introduced above. "
