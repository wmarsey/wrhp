These include epistemology, logic, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics.<ref name=\"nyu\"/><ref name=\"Aesthetics- definition\"/> Some of the major areas of study are considered individually below.\n\n===Epistemology===\n{{main|Epistemology}}\nEpistemology is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge,<ref name=\"Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary\"/> such as the relationships between [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[theory of justification|theories of justification]].\n\n[[Philosophical skepticism|Skepticism]] is the position which questions the possibility of completely justifying any truth. The [[regress argument]], a fundamental problem in epistemology, occurs when, in order to completely prove any statement, its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification. This chain can do three possible options, all of which are unsatisfactory according to the [[M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma]]. One option is [[infinitism]], where this chain of justification can go on forever. Another option is [[foundationalism]], where the chain of justifications eventually relies on [[basic beliefs]] or [[axiom]]s that are left unproven. The last option, such as in [[coherentism]], is making the chain [[circular argument|circular]] so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification.\n\n[[Rationalism]] is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge. [[Empiricism]] is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience over other evidence as the source of knowledge. Rationalism claims that every possible object of knowledge can be deduced from coherent premises without observation. Empiricism claims that at least some knowledge is only a matter of observation. For this, Empiricism often cites the concept of [[tabula rasa]], where individuals are not born with [[mental content]] and that knowledge builds from experience or perception. [[Epistemological solipsism]] is the idea that the existence of the world outside the mind is an unresolvable question.\n\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]]]\n[[Parmenides]] (fl. 500 BC) argued that it is impossible to doubt that thinking actually occurs. But thinking must have an object, therefore something ''beyond'' thinking really exists. Parmenides deduced that what really exists must have certain properties\u2014for example, that it cannot come into existence or cease to exist, that it is a coherent whole, that it remains the same eternally (in fact, exists altogether outside time). This is known as the [[third man argument]]. [[Plato]] (427\u2013347 BC) combined rationalism with a form of [[philosophical realism|realism]]. The philosopher's work is to consider being, and the essence ([[ousia]]) of things. But the characteristic of essences is that they are universal. The nature of a man, a triangle, a tree, applies to all men, all triangles, all trees. Plato argued that these essences are mind-independent \"[[theory of forms|forms]]\", that humans (but particularly philosophers) can come to know by reason, and by ignoring the distractions of sense-perception.\n\nModern rationalism begins with [[Descartes]]. Reflection on the nature of perceptual experience, as well as scientific discoveries in physiology and optics, led Descartes (and also [[John Locke|Locke]]) to the view that we are directly aware of ideas, rather than objects. This view gave rise to three questions:\n\n# Is an idea a true copy of the real thing that it represents? Sensation is not a direct interaction between bodily objects and our sense, but is a physiological process involving representation (for example, an image on the retina). Locke thought that a \"secondary quality\" such as a sensation of green could in no way resemble the arrangement of particles in matter that go to produce this sensation, although he thought that \"primary qualities\" such as shape, size, number, were really in objects.\n# How can physical objects such as chairs and tables, or even physiological processes in the brain, give rise to mental items such as ideas? This is part of what became known as the [[mind-body problem]].\n# If all the contents of awareness are ideas, how can we know that anything exists apart from ideas?\n\nDescartes tried to address the last problem by reason. He began, echoing Parmenides, with a principle that he thought could not coherently be denied: I ''think'', therefore I ''am'' (often given in his original Latin: ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''). From this principle, Descartes went on to construct a complete system of knowledge (which involves proving the [[existence of God]], using, among other means, a version of the [[ontological argument]]).<ref name=\"The Principles of Philosophy (IX)\"/> His view that reason alone could yield substantial truths about reality strongly influenced those philosophers usually considered modern rationalists (such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]), while provoking criticism from other philosophers who have retrospectively come to be grouped together as empiricists.\n\n===Logic===\n{{Main|Logic}}\nLogic is the study of the principles of correct [[reasoning]]. [[Argument]]s use either deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning. [[Deductive reasoning]] is when, given certain statements (called [[premise]]s), other statements (called conclusions) are [[logical consequence|unavoidably implied]]. [[Rules of inference]]s from premises include the most popular method, [[modus ponens]], where given \u201cA\u201d and \u201cIf A then B\u201d, then \u201cB\u201d must be concluded. A common convention for a deductive argument is the [[syllogism]]. An argument is termed [[validity|valid]] if its conclusion does follow from its premises, whether the premises are true or not, while an argument is [[soundness|sound]] if its conclusion follows from premises that are true. [[Propositional logic]] uses premises that are [[proposition]]s, which are [[Statement (logic)|declarations]] that are either true or false, while [[predicate logic]] uses more complex premises called [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulae]] that contain [[Variable (math)|variables]]. These can be assigned values or can be [[quantification|quantified]] as to when they apply with the [[universal quantifier]] (always apply) or the [[existential quantifier]] (applies at least once). [[Inductive reasoning]] makes conclusions or generalizations based on [[probabilistic reasoning]]. For example, if \u201c90% of humans are right-handed\u201d and \u201cJoe is human\u201d then \u201cJoe is probably right-handed\u201d. Fields in logic include [[mathematical logic]] (formal symbolic logic) and [[philosophical logic]].\n\n===Metaphysics===\n{{Main|Metaphysics}}\nMetaphysics is the study of the most general features of [[reality]], such as [[existence]], [[time]], the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]], [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[property (philosophy)|properties]], wholes and their parts, events, processes, and [[causality|causation]]. Traditional branches of metaphysics include [[cosmology]], the study of the [[world]] in its entirety, and [[ontology]], the study of [[being]].\n\nWithin metaphysics itself there are a wide range of differing philosophical [[theory|theories]]. [[Idealism]], for example, is the belief that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial while [[Philosophical realism|realism]] holds that reality, or at least some part of it, exists independently of the mind. [[Subjective idealism]] describes objects as no more than collections or \"bundles\" of sense data in the perceiver. The 18th-century philosopher [[George Berkeley]] contended that existence is fundamentally tied to perception with the phrase ''Esse est aut percipi aut percipere'' or \"To be is to be perceived or to perceive\".<ref name=\"Idealism\"/>\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned views, however, there is also an ontological [[dichotomy]] within metaphysics between the concepts of particulars and universals as well. [[Particular]]s are those objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to [[abstract objects]], such as numbers. [[Universals]] are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of [[existence]], if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of serious [[debate]] within metaphysical philosophy. [[philosophical realism|Realism]] is the philosophical position that universals do in fact exist, while [[nominalism]] is the negation, or denial of universals, abstract objects, or both.<ref name=\"stanford\"/> [[Conceptualism]] holds that universals exist, but only within the mind's perception.<ref name=\"conceptualism\"/>\n\nThe question of whether or not [[existence]] is a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]] has been discussed since the Early Modern period. [[Essence]] is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its [[Personal identity|identity]]. Essence is contrasted with [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]: a property that the substance has [[metaphysical contingency|contingently]], without which the substance can still retain its identity.\n\n===Ethics and political philosophy===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}\n{{Main|Ethics|Political philosophy}}\nEthics, or \"moral philosophy,\" is concerned primarily with the question of the best way to live, and secondarily, concerning the question of whether this question can be answered. The main branches of ethics are [[meta-ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]]. Meta-ethics concerns the nature of ethical thought, such as the origins of the words good and bad, and origins of other comparative words of various ethical systems, whether there are absolute ethical truths, and how such truths could be known.  Normative ethics are more concerned with the questions of how one ought to act, and what the right course of action is.  This is where most ethical theories are generated. Lastly, applied ethics go beyond theory and step into real world ethical practice, such as questions of whether or not abortion is correct. Ethics is also associated with the idea of [[morality]], and the two are often interchangeable.\n\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]\nOne debate that has commanded the attention of ethicists in the modern era has been between [[consequentialism]] (actions are to be morally evaluated solely by their ''consequences'') and [[deontology]] (actions are to be morally evaluated solely by consideration of agents' ''duties'', the ''rights'' of those whom the action concerns, or both). [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] are famous for propagating [[utilitarianism]], which is the idea that the fundamental moral rule is to strive toward the \"greatest happiness for the greatest number\". However, in promoting this idea they also necessarily promoted the broader doctrine of consequentialism. Adopting a position opposed to consequentialism, [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that moral principles were simply products of reason. Kant believed that the incorporation of consequences into moral deliberation was a deep mistake, since it denies the necessity of practical maxims in governing the working of the will. According to Kant, reason requires that we conform our actions to the [[categorical imperative]], which is an absolute duty. An important 20th-century deontologist, [[W.D. Ross]], argued for weaker forms of duties called [[prima facie duty|''prima facie'' duties]].\n\nMore recent works have emphasized the role of character in ethics, a movement known as the ''[[aretaic turn]]'' (that is, the ''turn towards virtues''). One strain of this movement followed the work of [[Bernard Williams]]. Williams noted that rigid forms of consequentialism and deontology demanded that people behave impartially. This, Williams argued, requires that people abandon their personal projects, and hence their personal [[integrity]], in order to be considered moral. [[G.E.M. Anscombe]], in an influential paper, \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" (1958), revived [[virtue ethics]] as an alternative to what was seen as the entrenched positions of Kantianism and consequentialism. Aretaic perspectives have been inspired in part by research of ancient conceptions of virtue. For example, [[Aristotle's ethics]] demands that people follow the ''Aristotelian mean'', or balance between two vices; and [[Confucius|Confucian]] ethics argues that virtue consists largely in striving for harmony with other people. Virtue ethics in general has since gained many adherents, and has been defended by such philosophers as [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]\n[[Political philosophy]] is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]]. It includes questions about justice, law, property, and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally inter-linked subjects, as both discuss the question of what is good and how people should live.\nFrom ancient times, and well beyond them, the roots of justification for political authority were inescapably tied to outlooks on human nature. In ''The Republic'', [[Plato]] presented the argument that the ideal society would be run by a council of [[philosopher-king]]s, since those best at philosophy are best able to realize the good. Even Plato, however, required philosophers to make their way in the world for many years before beginning their rule at the age of fifty. \n\nFor [[Aristotle]], humans are political animals (i.e. social animals), and governments are set up to pursue good for the community. Aristotle reasoned that, since the state (''[[polis]]'') was the highest form of community, it has the purpose of pursuing the highest good. Aristotle viewed political power as the result of natural inequalities in skill and virtue. Because of these differences, he favored an aristocracy of the able and virtuous. For Aristotle, the person cannot be complete unless he or she lives in a community. His ''The Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''The Politics'' are meant to be read in that order. The first book addresses virtues (or \"excellences\") in the person as a citizen; the second addresses the proper form of government to ensure that citizens will be virtuous, and therefore complete. Both books deal with the essential role of justice in civic life.\n\n[[Nicolas of Cusa]] rekindled Platonic thought in the early 15th century. He promoted democracy in Medieval Europe, both in his writings and in his organization of the Council of Florence. Unlike Aristotle and the Hobbesian tradition to follow, Cusa saw human beings as equal and divine (that is, made in God's image), so democracy would be the only just form of government. Cusa's views are credited by some as sparking the Italian Renaissance, which gave rise to the notion of \"Nation-States\".\n\n[[File:Hegel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]]]\nLater, [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] rejected the views of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as unrealistic. The ideal sovereign is not the embodiment of the moral virtues; rather the sovereign does whatever is successful and necessary, rather than what is morally praiseworthy. [[Thomas Hobbes]] also contested many elements of Aristotle's views. For Hobbes, human nature is essentially anti-social: people are essentially egoistic, and this egoism makes life difficult in the natural state of things. Moreover, Hobbes argued, though people may have natural inequalities, these are trivial, since no particular talents or virtues that people may have will make them safe from harm inflicted by others. For these reasons, Hobbes concluded that the state arises from a common agreement to raise the community out of the [[state of nature]]. This can only be done by the establishment of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], in which (or whom) is vested complete control over the community, and is able to inspire awe and terror in its subjects.<ref name=\"Leviathan\"/>\n\n[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[David Hume]]]]\nMany in the Enlightenment were unsatisfied with existing doctrines in political philosophy, which seemed to marginalize or neglect the possibility of a [[democracy|democratic state]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was among those who attempted to overturn these doctrines: he responded to Hobbes by claiming that a human is by nature a kind of \"[[noble savage]]\", and that society and social contracts corrupt this nature. Another critic was [[John Locke]]. In ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise on Government]]'' he agreed with Hobbes that the nation-state was an efficient tool for raising humanity out of a deplorable state, but he argued that the sovereign might become an abominable institution compared to the relatively benign unmodulated state of nature.<ref name=\"The Selected Political Writings of John Locke\"/>\n\nFollowing the doctrine of the [[fact-value distinction]], due in part to the influence of [[David Hume]] and his student [[Adam Smith]], appeals to human nature for political justification were weakened. Nevertheless, many political philosophers, especially [[moral realism|moral realists]], still make use of some essential human nature as a basis for their arguments.\n\n[[Marxism]] is derived from the work of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. Their idea that capitalism is based on exploitation of workers and causes alienation of people from their human nature, the [[historical materialism]], their view of [[social classes]], etc., have influenced many fields of study, such as sociology, economics, and politics. Marxism inspired the Marxist school of [[communism]], which brought a huge impact on the history of the 20th century.\n\n===Aesthetics===\n{{Main|Aesthetics}}\nAesthetics deals with [[beauty]], [[art]], enjoyment, sensory-emotional values, perception, and matters of taste and sentiment.\n\n===Specialized branches===\n* '''[[Philosophy of language]]''' explores the nature, the origins, and the use of language.\n* '''[[Philosophy of law]]''' (often called '''[[jurisprudence]]''') explores the varying theories explaining the nature and the interpretations of the law in society.\n* '''[[Philosophy of mind]]''' explores the nature of the mind, and its relationship to the body, and is typified by disputes between [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[materialism]]. In recent years there has been increasing similarity between this branch of philosophy and [[cognitive science]].\n* '''[[Philosophy of religion]]'''\n* '''[[Philosophy of science]]'''\n* '''[[Metaphilosophy]]'''\n\nMany academic disciplines have also generated philosophical inquiry. These include [[Philosophy of History|history]], [[philosophy of logic|logic]], and [[Philosophy of mathematics|mathematics]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of philosophy}}\n{{see also|Western philosophy|Eastern philosophy|History of Western philosophy}}\n{{further|Philosophical progress}}\nMany societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophical traditions based upon each other's works.\n\n[[Eastern philosophy]] is organized by the chronological periods of each region. Historians of western philosophy usually divide the subject into three or more periods, the most important being [[ancient philosophy]], [[medieval philosophy]], and [[modern philosophy]].<ref name=\"renaissance\"/>\n\n===Ancient philosophy===\n{{Main|Ancient philosophy}}\n\n====Egypt and Babylon====\n{{further2|[[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]|[[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]}}\n{{Main|African philosophy}}\nThere are authors who date the philosophical maxims of Ptahhotep before the 25th century. For instance, Pulitzer Prize winning historian Will Durant dates these writings as early as 2880 BCE within ''[[The Story of Civilization|The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental History]]''. Durant claims that Ptahhotep could be considered the very first philosopher in virtue of having the earliest and surviving fragments of moral philosophy (i.e., \"The Maxims of Ptah-Hotep\").<ref name=\"The Maxims of Good Discourse\"/><ref name=\"literature\"/> Ptahhotep's grandson, Ptahhotep Tshefi, is traditionally credited with being the author of the collection of wise sayings known as ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'',<ref name=\"grimal\"/> whose opening lines attribute authorship to the vizier Ptahhotep: ''Instruction  of  the  Mayor  of  the  city,  the  Vizier Ptahhotep, under the Majesty of King Isesi''.\n\nThe origins of [[Babylonia]]n philosophy can be traced back to the wisdom of early [[Mesopotamia]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialogue]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. The [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] of the Babylonians developed beyond [[empiricism|empirical]] observation.<ref name=\"mesopotamia\"/> The Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agnostic]] thought of the [[sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogues of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]] and Plato.<ref name=\"mesopotamia2\"/> The [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also traditionally said to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.\n\n====Ancient Chinese====\n[[File:Confucius - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Confucius]], illustrated in ''Myths & Legends of China'', 1922, by E.T.C. Werner.]]\n{{Main|Chinese philosophy}}\nPhilosophy has had a tremendous effect on [[China|Chinese civilization]], and throughout [[East Asia]]. The majority of Chinese philosophy originates in the [[Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period|Warring States]] era, during a period known as the \"[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]\",<ref name=\"pe\"/> which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.<ref name=\"pe\"/> It was during this era that the major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], arose,  along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity, like [[Agriculturalism]], [[School of Naturalists|Chinese Naturalism]], and the [[School of Names|Logicians]]. Of the many philosophical schools of China, only Confucianism and Taoism existed after the [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|suppressed any Chinese philosophy]] that was opposed to Legalism.\n\nConfucianism is [[humanism|humanistic]],<ref name=\"juergensmeyer\"/>  philosophy that believes that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucianism focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics, the most basic of which are ''ren'', ''yi'', and ''li''.<ref name=\"craig2\"/> ''Ren'' is an obligation of [[altruism]] and humaneness for other individuals within a community, ''yi'' is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good, and ''li'' is a system of norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act within a community.<ref name=\"craig2\"/>\n\n[[Taoism]] focuses on establishing harmony with the [[Tao]], which is origin of and the totality of everything that exists. The word \"Tao\" (or \"Dao\", depending on the [[romanization]] scheme) is usually translated as \"way\", \"path\" or \"principle\".  Taoist propriety and ethics emphasize the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Jewels of the Tao]]: [[compassion]], [[moderation]], and [[humility]], while Taoist thought generally focuses on [[nature]], the relationship between humanity and the cosmos ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u4eba\u76f8\u5e94}}); [[health]] and [[longevity]]; and [[wu wei]], action through inaction. Harmony with the [[Universe]], or the origin of it through the Tao, is the intended result of many Taoist rules and practices.\n\n====Ancient Graeco-Roman====\n{{main|Hellenistic philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophy}}\n[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] (''left'') and [[Aristotle]] (''right''): detail from ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raffaello Sanzio]], 1509]]\nAncient Graeco-Roman philosophy is a period of Western philosophy, starting in the 6th century [c. 585] BC to the 6th century AD. It is usually divided into three periods: the [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic period]], the Ancient Classical Greek period of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and the post-Aristotelian (or [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]]) period. A fourth period that is sometimes added includes the [[Neoplatonic]] and [[Christian]] philosophers of [[Late Antiquity]]. The most important of the ancient philosophers (in terms of subsequent influence) are Plato and Aristotle.<ref name=\"Oxford Companion to Philosophy\"/> Plato specifically, is credited as the founder of Western philosophy. The philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] said of Plato: \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. I do not mean the systematic scheme of thought which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings. I allude to the wealth of general ideas scattered through them.\"<ref name=\"process\"/>\n\nIt was said in Roman Ancient history that [[Pythagoras]] was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom,<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8\u20139 = [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli, [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97\u2013102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.</ref> and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato, and through him, all of [[Western philosophy]]. Plato and Aristotle, the first [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] philosophers, did refer critically to other simple \"wise men\", which were called in Greek \"[[sophist]]s,\" and which were common before Pythagoras' time. From their critique it appears that a distinction was then established in their own Classical period between the more elevated and pure \"lovers of wisdom\" (the true Philosophers), and these other earlier and more common traveling teachers, who often also earned money from their craft.\n\nThe main subjects of ancient philosophy are: understanding the fundamental causes and principles of the [[universe]]; explaining it in an economical way; the epistemological problem of reconciling the diversity and change of the natural universe, with the possibility of obtaining fixed and certain knowledge about it; questions about things that cannot be perceived by the senses, such as [[number]]s, [[classical element|elements]], [[universals]], and [[gods]]. Socrates is said to have been the initiator of more focused study upon the human things including the analysis of patterns of [[reasoning]] and argument and the nature of [[the good life]] and the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to pursue it; the explication of the concept of [[justice]], and its relation to various [[political systems]].<ref name=\"Oxford Companion to Philosophy\"/>\n\nIn this period the crucial features of the Western [[philosophical method]] were established: a critical approach to received or established views, and the appeal to reason and argumentation. This includes Socrates' [[dialectic]] method of inquiry, known as the [[Socratic method]] or method of \"elenchus\", which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and [[Justice]]. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The influence of this approach is most strongly felt today in the use of the [[scientific method]], in which [[hypothesis]] is the first stage.\n\n====Ancient Indian====\n{{Main|Indian philosophy}}\n{{Further|Hindu philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Jain philosophy|Upanishads}}\nThe term Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: ''Darshanas''), refers to any of several schools of [[Eastern philosophy|philosophical thought]] that originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]], including [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Buddhist philosophy]], and [[Jain philosophy]]. Having the same or rather intertwined origins, all of these philosophies have a common underlying themes of [[Dharma]] and [[Karma]], and similarly attempt to explain the attainment of emancipation. They have been formalized and promulgated chiefly between 1000 BC to a few centuries AD.\n\n[[India]]'s philosophical tradition dates back to the composition of the [[Upanisads]]<ref name=\"principal\"/> in the [[Vedic period#The later Vedic period|later Vedic period]] (c. 1000-500 BCE). Subsequent schools ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''Darshanas'') of Indian philosophy were identified as orthodox ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''[[astika]]'') or non-orthodox (Skt: ''nastika'') depending on whether they regarded the [[Vedas]] as an infallible source of knowledge.<ref name=\"dictionary\"/> By some classifications, there are six schools of orthodox [[Hindu philosophy]] and three heterodox schools. The orthodox are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Purva mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]]. The Heterodox are [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and materialist ([[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]]). Other classifications also include [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pashupata]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Saiva]], [[Rase\u015bvara]] and [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] Dar\u015bana with the other orthodox schools.<ref name=\"Sarva-Darsana Sangraha of Madhava Acharya: Review of Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy\"/>\n\nCompetition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 500 BC to 200 AD. Some like the [[Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Shaiva]] and [[Vedanta]] schools survived, while others like [[Samkhya]] and [[Ajivika]] did not, either being assimilated or going extinct. The [[Sanskrit]] term for \"philosopher\" is ''{{IAST|d\u0101r\u015banika}}'', one who is familiar with the systems of philosophy, or ''{{IAST|dar\u015banas}}''.<ref name=\"apte\"/>\n\nIn the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]], following the establishment of a [[Vedic period|Vedic]] culture, the development of philosophical and religious thought over a period of two millennia gave rise to what came to be called the six schools of ''[[Nastika|astika]]'', or orthodox, Indian or Hindu philosophy. These schools have come to be synonymous with the greater religion of [[Hinduism]], which was a development of the early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].\n\n====Ancient Persian====\n{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}\nPersian philosophy can be traced back as far as Old Iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts, with their ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots. These were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social influences such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]], and the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thought arose. These espoused a variety of views on philosophical questions, extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-influenced traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era, such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]], as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]] is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. [[Illuminationism]] and the [[transcendent theosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia. Zoroastrianism has been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy.<ref name=\"Blackburn\"/>\n\n===5th\u201316th centuries===\n\n====Europe====\n\n=====Medieval=====\n{{Main|Medieval philosophy}}\n[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]|upright]]\nMedieval philosophy is the philosophy of [[Western Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] during the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]]) with [[secularism|secular]] learning.\n\nThe history of western European medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the [[Latin West]] following the [[Early Middle Ages]] until the 12th century, when the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] were preserved and cultivated; and the \"golden age\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, and significant developments in the field of [[philosophy of religion]], [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].\n\nThe medieval era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric \"middle\" period between the classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the \"rebirth\" or ''renaissance'' of classical culture. Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe, and possibly the richest. [[Jorge Gracia]] has argued that \"in intensity, sophistication, and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C.\"<ref name=\"gracia\"/>\n\nSome problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of [[God]], the object of [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.\n\nPhilosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]], [[Ibn Khald\u016bn]], and [[Averroes]]. The medieval tradition of [[Scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].\n\nAquinas, father of [[Thomism]], was immensely influential in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.\n\n=====Renaissance=====\n{{Main|Renaissance philosophy}}\n[[File:Giordano Bruno Campo dei Fiori.jpg|thumb|[[Giordano Bruno]]|upright]]\nThe Renaissance (\"rebirth\") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,<ref name=\"contemporaries\"/> in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.<ref name=\"philosophies\"/><ref name=\"renaissance3\"/> The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].<ref name=\"transmission\"/><ref name=\"naturalistic\"/>  Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.<ref name=\"intellectual\"/><ref name=\"The Renaissance Philosophy of Man\"/>\n\nThe study of classical philosophy also developed in two new ways. On the one hand, the study of Aristotle was changed through the influence of [[Averroism]]. The disagreements between these Averroist Aristotelians, and more orthodox catholic Aristotelians such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] eventually contributed to the development of a \"humanist Aristotelianism\" developed in the Renaissance, as exemplified in the thought of [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] and [[Giacomo Zabarella]]. Secondly, as an alternative to Aristotle, the study of [[Plato]] and the [[Neoplatonists]] became common. This was assisted by the rediscovery of works which had not been well known previously in Western Europe. Notable Renaissance Platonists include [[Nicholas of Cusa]], and later [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]].<ref name=\"The Renaissance Philosophy of Man\"/>\n\nThe Renaissance also renewed interest in anti-Aristotelian theories of nature considered as an organic, living whole comprehensible independently of theology, as in the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Nicholas Copernicus]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Telesius]], and [[Tommaso Campanella]].<ref name=\"renaissance4\"/> Such movements in natural philosophy dovetailed with a revival of interest in occultism, magic, [[hermeticism]], and [[astrology]], which were thought to yield hidden ways of knowing and mastering nature (e.g., in Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola).<ref name=\"philosophicae\"/>\n\nThese new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the decline of [[feudalism]].  Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of [[fideism]] and skepticism in thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Francisco Sanches]].<ref name=\"scepticism\"/><ref name=\"copleston\"/><ref name=\"reformation\"/>  Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] (often described as the first modern political thinker, or a key turning point towards modern political thinking<ref name=\"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\"/>), [[Thomas More]], [[Erasmus]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Jean Bodin]], and [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name=\"renaissance5\"/><ref name=\"renaissance6\"/>\n\n====East Asia====\n{{Main|Neo-Confucianism|Japanese philosophy|Korean philosophy}}\n[[Mid-Imperial China|Mid-Imperial Chinese]] philosophy is primarily defined by the development of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. During the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. (It should be noted that philosophy and religion were clearly distinguished in the West, whilst these concepts were more continuous in the East due to, for example, the philosophical concepts of Buddhism.)\n\n[[Neo-Confucianism]] is a philosophical movement that advocated a more rationalist and secular form of [[Confucianism]] by rejecting superstitious and mystical elements of [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han Dynasty.<ref name=\"Japanese Philosophy\"/> Although the Neo-Confucianists were critical of Daoism and Buddhism,<ref name=\"huang5\"/> the two did have an influence on the philosophy, and the Neo-Confucianists borrowed terms and concepts from both. However, unlike the Buddhists and Daoists, who saw [[metaphysics]] as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and immortality, the Neo-Confucianists used metaphysics as a guide for developing a rationalist [[ethics|ethical]] philosophy.<ref name=\"CSB\"/>\n\nNeo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang Dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholars [[Han Yu]] and [[Li Ao]] are seen as forbears of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty.<ref name=\"huang5\"/> The Song Dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true \"pioneer\" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.<ref name=\"CSB\"/>\n\nElsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese Philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Indian philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] the emotional content of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] was integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China.\n\n====India====\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Adi Shankara.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Adi Shankara]]]] -->\n{{Main|Indian philosophy|Hindu philosophy}}\nThe period between 5th and 9th centuries CE was the most brilliant epoch in the development of Indian philosophy as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side.<ref name=\"banarsidass\"/> Of these various schools of thought the non-dualistic [[Advaita Vedanta]] emerged as the most influential<ref name=\"google\"/> and most dominant school of philosophy.<ref name=\"Gandhi And Mahayana Buddhism\"/> The major philosophers of this school were [[Gaudapada]], [[Adi Shankara]] and [[Vidyaranya]].\n\nAdvaita Vedanta rejects theism and dualism by insisting that \u201c[[Brahman]] [ultimate reality] is without parts or attributes...one without a second.\u201d  Since Brahman has no properties, contains no internal diversity and is identical with the whole reality, it cannot be understood as God.<ref name=\"stanford7\"/> Brahman though being indescribable is at best described as Satchidananda (merging \"Sat\" + \"Chit\" + \"Ananda\", i.e., Existence, Consciousness and Bliss) by Shankara. Advaita ushered a new era in Indian philosophy and as a result, many new schools of thought arose in the medieval period. Some of them were [[Visishtadvaita]] (qualified monism), [[Dvaita]] (dualism), [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism-nondualism), [[Suddhadvaita]] (pure non-dualism), [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] and [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhij\u00f1a]] (the recognitive school).\n\n====Middle East====\n{{Main|Islamic philosophy}}\nIn early Islamic thought, which refers to philosophy during the \"[[Islamic Golden Age]]\", traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries, two main currents may be distinguished. The first is [[Kalam]], that mainly dealt with [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] questions. These include the [[Mu'tazili]] and [[Ash'ari]]. The other is [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]], that was founded on interpretations of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. There were attempts by later philosopher-theologians at harmonizing both trends, notably by [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]] who founded the school of [[Avicennism]], [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averro\u00ebs)]] who founded the school of [[Averroism]], and others such as [[Alhacen|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)]] and [[Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b]].\n\n===17th\u201320th centuries===\n\n====Early modern philosophy====\n{{Main|17th-century_philosophy|Age_of_Enlightenment|Early modern philosophy}}\n[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]]]\n\nChronologically, the early modern era of Western philosophy is usually identified with the 17th and 18th centuries, with the 18th century often being referred to as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"philosophers\"/> Modern philosophy is distinguished from its predecessors by its increasing independence from traditional authorities such as the Church, academia, and Aristotelianism;<ref name=\"philosophical8\"/><ref name=\"approaching\"/> a new focus on the foundations of knowledge and metaphysical system-building;<ref name=\"epistemology\"/><ref name=\"metaphysical\"/> and the emergence of modern physics out of natural philosophy.<ref name=\"independently\"/> \n\nOther central topics of philosophy in this period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and God, and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy.<ref name=\"philosophy9\"/> These trends first distinctively coalesce in [[Francis Bacon]]'s call for a new, empirical program for expanding knowledge, and soon found massively influential form in the mechanical physics and rationalist metaphysics of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].<ref name=\"philosophical10\"/> \n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first to apply this methodology systematically to [[political philosophy]] and is the originator of modern political philosophy, including the modern theory of a \"[[social contract]]\".<ref name=\"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy11\"/><ref name=\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\"/> The academic canon of early modern philosophy generally includes [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],<ref name=\"philosophical12\"/><ref name=\"traditional\"/><ref name=\"philosophical13\"/> though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period, such as [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Pierre Bayle]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[Jean d'Alembert]], and [[Adam Smith]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was a seminal figure in initiating reaction against the Enlightenment. The approximate end of the early modern period is most often identified with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s systematic attempt to limit metaphysics, justify scientific knowledge, and reconcile both of these with morality and freedom.<ref name=\"rutherford\"/><ref name=\"philosophy14\"/><ref name=\"philosophy15\"/>\n\n====19th-century philosophy====\n{{Main|19th-century philosophy}}\n\nLater modern philosophy is usually considered to begin after the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] at the beginning of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Shand\"/>  German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German university system.<ref name=\"universities\"/>  [[German idealist]]s, such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.<ref name=\"frederick\"/>  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s identification of this world-constituting process as an irrational [[will to live]] influenced later 19th- and early 20th-century thinking, such as the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].\n\nAfter Hegel's death in 1831, 19th-century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], such as the [[positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], the empiricism of [[John Stuart Mill]], and the materialism of [[Karl Marx]].  Logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline, as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of [[George Boole]] and [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref name=\"transformation\"/>  Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include:\n* [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]], whose work in logic and ethics, respectively, provided the tools for early [[analytic philosophy]].\n* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], who founded [[pragmatism]].\n* [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who laid the groundwork for [[existentialism]] and [[post-structuralism]].\n\n====20th-century philosophy====\n{{Main|Contemporary philosophy}}\n[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bertrand Russell]]]]\nWithin the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: \"Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields.\"<ref name=\"philosophical16\"/>\n\nIn the English-speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]] became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. In the first half of the century, it was a cohesive school, shaped strongly by [[logical positivism]], united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to [[logic]] and [[language]]. The pioneering work of [[Bertrand Russell]] was a model for the early development of analytic philosophy, moving from a rejection of the idealism dominant in late 19th-century British philosophy to an neo-Humean empiricism, strengthened by the conceptual resources of modern mathematical logic.<ref name=\"stanford\"/><ref name=\"encyclopedia17\"/><ref name=\"philosophers18\"/> \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, [[analytic philosophy]] diffused into a wide variety of disparate philosophical views, only loosely united by historical lines of influence and a self-identified commitment to clarity and rigor. The post-war transformation of the analytic program led in two broad directions: on one hand, an interest in ordinary language as a way of avoiding or redescribing traditional philosophical problems, and on the other, a more thoroughgoing [[naturalized epistemology|naturalism]] that sought to dissolve the puzzles of modern philosophy via the results of the natural sciences (such as cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology). The shift in the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], from a view congruent with logical positivism to a therapeutic dissolution of traditional philosophy as a linguistic misunderstanding of normal forms of life, was the most influential version of the first direction in analytic philosophy.<ref name=\"wittgenstein\"/><ref name=\"utm\"/> The later work of Russell and the philosophy of [[W.V.O. Quine]] are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"contemporary\"/><ref name=\"encyclopedia19\"/><ref name=\"uncontroversially\"/><ref name=\"wittgenstein20\"/> But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a \"new metaphysics\" of [[possible worlds]], as in the influential work of [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]].<ref name=\"stanford21\"/><ref name=\"introduction\"/> Recently, the [[experimental philosophy]] movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.\n\nOn continental Europe, no single school or temperament enjoyed dominance. The flight of the logical positivists from central Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, however, diminished philosophical interest in natural science, and an emphasis on the humanities, broadly construed, figures prominently in what is usually called \"[[continental philosophy]]\". 20th-century movements such as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], modern [[hermeneutics]], [[critical theory]], [[structuralism]], and [[poststructuralism]] are included within this loose category.  The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective,<ref name=\"stanford22\"/><ref name=\"utm23\"/> while [[Martin Heidegger]] drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional [[existential]] approach to [[ontology]].<ref name=\"influential\"/><ref name=\"utm24\"/>\n\nIn the Arab-speaking world [[Arab nationalist]] philosophy became the dominant school of thought, involving philosophers such as [[Michel Aflaq]], [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]] of [[ba'athism]] and [[Sati' al-Husri]]. These people disregarded much of Marx's research, and were mostly concerned with the individual's spirituality which would, in the fight against imperialism and oppression, lead to a united [[Arab Nation]].\n\n==Major traditions==\n\n===German idealism===\n{{Main|German idealism}}\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]\nForms of idealism were prevalent in philosophy from the 18th century to the early 20th century. Transcendental idealism, advocated by [[Immanuel Kant]], is the view that there are limits on what can be understood, since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781\u20131787) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Kant's intention with this work was to look at what we know and then consider what must be true about it, as a logical consequence of the ''way'' we know it. One major theme was that there are fundamental features of reality that escape our direct knowledge because of the natural limits of the human faculties.<ref name=\"Critique of Pure Reason\"/> Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a [[conceptual framework|conceptual]] or [[categorical framework]] on the stream of pure sensory data\u2014a framework including space and time themselves\u2014he maintained that ''things-in-themselves'' existed independently of our perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant's account of ''things-in-themselves'' is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]] dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.\n\nThe most notable work of this [[German idealism]] was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between \"being\" and \"not being\"), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination (\"being\" and \"not being\" are resolved with \"becoming\"). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the \"Hegelian [[dialectic]]\". Philosophers influenced by Hegel include [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]], who coined the term projection as pertaining to our inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; [[Karl Marx]]; [[Friedrich Engels]]; and the [[British idealism|British idealists]], notably [[T. H. Green]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] and [[F. H. Bradley]].\n\nFew 20th-century philosophers have embraced idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic. Immanuel Kant's \"Copernican Turn\" also remains an important philosophical concept today.\n\n===Pragmatism===\n{{Main|Pragmatism|Instrumentalism}}\n[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]]]\nPragmatism was founded in the spirit of finding a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. The meaning or purport of a statement should be judged by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Truth is that opinion which inquiry taken far enough would ultimately reach.<ref>Peirce, C. S. (1878), \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]\", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, 286\u2013302. Reprinted often, including ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 388\u2013410 and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, 124\u201341. See end of \u00a7II for the pragmatic maxim. See third and fourth paragraphs in \u00a7IV for the discoverability of truth and the real by sufficient investigation. Also see quotes from Peirce from across the years in the entries for [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/truth.html \"Truth\"] and [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmatismmaxim.html \"Pragmatism, Maxim of...\"] in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.</ref> For Charles Sanders Peirce these were principles of the inquirer's self-regulation, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not generally fruitless. The details of how these principles should be interpreted have been subject to discussion since  Peirce first conceived them. Peirce's [[Pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]] is as follows: \"Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\"<ref name=\"paragraphs\"/> Like [[postmodern]] neo-pragmatist [[Richard Rorty]], many are convinced that pragmatism asserts that the truth of beliefs does not consist in their correspondence with reality, but in their usefulness and efficacy.<ref name=\"Rorty\"/>\n\nThe late 19th-century [[American philosophy|American philosophers]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] were its co-founders, and it was later developed by [[John Dewey]] as [[instrumentalism]]. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualised final truth as something only established by the future, final settlement of all opinion.<ref name=\"Putnam\"/> Critics have accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is the basis for its truth.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Thinkers in the pragmatist tradition have included John Dewey, [[George Santayana]], [[W. V. O. Quine]] and [[C. I. Lewis]]. Pragmatism has more recently been taken in new directions by Richard Rorty, [[John Lachs]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Susan Haack]], and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n===Phenomenology===\n{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}\n[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called ''[[intentionality]]''.<ref name=\"Dreyfus\"/>\n\nIn the first part of his two-volume work, the ''Logical Investigations'' (1901), he launched an extended attack on [[psychologism]]. In the second part, he began to develop the technique of ''descriptive phenomenology'', with the aim of showing how objective judgments are grounded in conscious experience\u2014not, however, in the first-person experience of particular individuals, but in the properties essential to any experiences of the kind in question.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n\nHe also attempted to identify the essential properties of any act of meaning. He developed the method further in ''Ideas'' (1913) as ''transcendental phenomenology'', proposing to ground actual experience, and thus all fields of human knowledge, in the structure of consciousness of an ideal, or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], ego. Later, he attempted to reconcile his transcendental standpoint with an acknowledgement of the intersubjective [[life-world]] in which real individual subjects interact. Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses.\n\nHusserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich and G\u00f6ttingen. Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as [[Martin Heidegger]] (formerly Husserl's research assistant), [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of [[existentialism]].\n\n===Existentialism===\n{{Main|Existentialism}}\nExistentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,<ref name=\"existentialism\"/><ref name=\"philosophy25\"/> shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject\u2014not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.<ref name=\"existentialism26\"/> In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called \"the existential attitude\", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.<ref name=\"existentialism27\"/> Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.<ref name=\"existentialism28\"/><ref name=\"existentialism29\"/>\n[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]]]\n\nAlthough they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought.<ref name=\"kierkegaard\"/><ref name=\"Bob\"/><ref name=\"existentialists\"/>\n\nThe main target of Kierkegaard's writings was the idealist philosophical system of [[Hegel]] which, he thought, ignored or excluded the inner subjective life of living human beings. Kierkegaard, conversely, held that \"truth is subjectivity\", arguing that what is most important to an actual human being are questions dealing with an individual's inner relationship to existence. In particular, Kierkegaard, a Christian, believed that the truth of religious faith was a subjective question, and one to be wrestled with passionately.<ref name=\"Fear and Trembling\"/><ref name=\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\"/>\n\nAlthough Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were among his influences, the extent to which the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In ''[[Being and Time]]'' he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (''Dasein'') to be analysed in terms of existential categories (''existentiale''); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement. However, in ''The Letter on Humanism'', Heidegger explicitly rejected the existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].\n\nSartre became the best-known proponent of existentialism, exploring it not only in theoretical works such as ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', but also in plays and novels. Sartre, along with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], represented an avowedly atheistic branch of existentialism, which is now more closely associated with their ideas of nausea, contingency, bad faith, and the absurd than with Kierkegaard's spiritual angst. Nevertheless, the focus on the individual human being, responsible before the universe for the authenticity of his or her existence, is common to all these thinkers.\n\n===Structuralism and post-structuralism===\n{{Main|Structuralism|Post-structuralism}}\n[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]\nInaugurated by the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the [[discourse]]s they both limit and make possible. Saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks man.\n\nStructuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by poststructuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize it. Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines, while the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossible.\n\nStructuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Post-structuralism came to predominate over the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and even [[Roland Barthes]]; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations.\n\n===The analytic tradition===\n{{Main|Analytic philosophy}}\nThe term ''analytic philosophy'' roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non-classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of our language, while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy is continuous with science. [[Michael Dummett]] in his ''Origins of Analytical Philosophy'' makes the case for counting [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'' as the first analytic work, on the grounds that in that book Frege took the linguistic turn, analyzing philosophical problems through language. [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G.E. Moore]] are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, beginning with their rejection of British idealism, their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis. Russell's classic works ''The Principles of Mathematics'',<ref name=\"russell\"/> ''[[On Denoting]]'' and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy, set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition, emphasizing such problems as: the reference of proper names, whether 'existence' is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, the discussions on the foundations of mathematics; as well as exploring issues of ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind, persistence and change, which Russell tackled often with the aid of mathematical logic. Russell and Moore's philosophy, in the beginning of the 20th century, developed as a critique of [[Hegel]] and his British followers in particular, and of grand systems of [[speculative philosophy]] in general, though by no means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy of Hegel (see [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]) nor speculative philosophy. Some schools in the group include [[logical positivism]], and [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] both markedly influenced by Russell and Wittgenstein's development of [[Logical Atomism]] the former positively and the latter negatively.\n\nIn 1921, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who studied under Russell at Cambridge, published his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', which gave a rigidly \"logical\" account of linguistic and philosophical issues. At the time, he understood most of the problems of philosophy as mere puzzles of language, which could be solved by investigating and then minding the logical structure of language. Years later, he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the ''Tractatus'', in for example his second major work, ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953). ''Investigations'' was influential in the development of \"ordinary language philosophy,\" which was promoted by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[J.L. Austin]], and a few others. In the United States, meanwhile, the philosophy of [[W.V.O. Quine]] was having a major influence, with such classics as [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]. In that paper Quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable. He argued for holism, the thesis that language, including scientific language, is a set of interconnected sentences, none of which can be verified on its own, rather, the sentences in the language depend on each other for their meaning and truth conditions. A consequence of Quine's approach is that language as a whole has only a thin relation to experience. Some sentences that refer directly to experience might be modified by sense impressions, but as the whole of language is theory-laden, for the whole language to be modified, more than this is required. However, most of the linguistic structure can in principle be revised, even logic, in order to better model the world. Notable students of Quine include [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. The former devised a program for giving a semantics to natural language and thereby answer the philosophical conundrum \"what is meaning?\". A crucial part of the program was the use of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s semantic theory of truth. Dummett, among others, argued that truth conditions should be dispensed within the theory of meaning, and replaced by assertibility conditions. Some propositions, on this view, are neither true nor false, and thus such a theory of meaning entails a rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]]. This, for Dummett, entails antirealism, as Russell himself pointed out in his ''An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth''.\n\n[[File:Robert nozick.jpg|200px|upright|thumb|[[Robert Nozick]]]]\nBy the 1970s there was a renewed interest in many traditional philosophical problems by the younger generations of analytic philosophers. [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Derek Parfit]] and others took an interest in traditional metaphysical problems, which they began exploring by the use of logic and philosophy of language. Among those problems some distinguished ones were: free will, [[essentialism]], the nature of personal identity, identity over time, the nature of the mind, the nature of causal laws, space-time, the properties of material beings, modality, etc. In those universities where analytic philosophy has spread, these problems are still being discussed passionately. Analytic philosophers are also interested in the methodology of analytic philosophy itself, with [[Timothy Williamson]], Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, publishing recently a book entitled ''The Philosophy of Philosophy''. Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: Timothy Williamson, [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[John Searle]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[Peter van Inwagen]] and [[Saul Kripke]]. Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' by [[John Rawls]] and ''[[Anarchy, State and Utopia]]'' by [[Robert Nozick]], analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with [[Roger Scruton]], [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Arthur Danto]] and others developing the subject to its current shape.\n\n==Applied philosophy==\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]]-->\nThe ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. The applied study of philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]]\u2014[[applied ethics]] in particular\u2014and [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu|Sun Zi]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taimiyyah]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and others\u2014all of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions.\n\nIn the field of [[philosophy of education]], progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey]] has had a profound impact on educational practices in the [[United States]] in the 20th century. Descendants of this movement include the current efforts in [[philosophy for children]], which are part of [[philosophy education]]. [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]], and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially in the years around [[World War II]]. Logic has become crucially important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], and [[computer engineering]].\n\nOther important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence, and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]], and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. As such, philosophy has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of Skinner's behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]], and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.\n\nOften philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge. For example, what were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]], and [[economics]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of philosophy}}\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[List of important publications in philosophy]]\n* [[List of years in philosophy]]\n* [[List of philosophers]]\n* [[List of philosophy journals]]\n* [[List of unsolved problems in philosophy]]\n* [[Social theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Aesthetics- definition\">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetics|title=Aesthetics- definition|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=2010-12-14}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"approaching\">[[Anthony Kenny]], ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. xii: \"To someone approaching the early modern period of philosophy from an ancient and medieval background the most striking feature of the age is the absence of Aristotle from the philosophic scene.\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"apte\">Apte, p. 497.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"banarsidass\">{{cite book |last= Sharma |first=Peri Sarveswara |year=1980 | page= 5| title=Anthology of Kum\u0101rilabha\u1e6d\u1e6da's Works |publisher=Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Blackburn\">{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |author=Blackburn, Simon |year=1994 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bob\">{{cite book |author=Solomon, Robert |title=What Nietzsche Really Said |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-8052-1094-1 |publisher=Schocken}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"conceptualism\">Strawson, P.

Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kierkegaard\">{{cite book |author=Matustik, Martin J. |title=Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-253-20967-2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Leviathan\">{{cite book |author= Hobbes, Thomas |title=Leviathan |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1985}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"literature\">M.
